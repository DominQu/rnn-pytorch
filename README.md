# Recurrent neural network for text generation in PyTorch

This projects implements a rnn with lstm layer to generate text with a style of given author. It is a proof of concept for custom neural network written in CUDA.
Project implementing the rnn in CUDA can be found [here](https://github.com/DominQu/rnn-cuda).
